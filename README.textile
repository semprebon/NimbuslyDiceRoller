h1. Nimbusly Dice Roller

Nimbusly Dice Roller is a dice rolling application implemented in Coffeescript.

I wrote this as a demonstration project in order to learn CoffeeScript. It is loosely based on my java project, 
DroidDice:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.droiddice&hl=en. It also includes code for computing dice
probabilities for various ways of reading the dice (i.e., dice pools, sum, etc).
